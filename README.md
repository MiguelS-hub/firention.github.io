hi kevin. This is my homework, i have fixed every piece of code that i found that needed improvement. i was also able to relink the links that were not working in the html. The css was also cleaned and fixed to make it more appealing to the eye. When i uploaded this to the repo, my css did not appear but i am at the moment trying to fix it.
